    <p>
        Your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle any data that may be collected
        or processed when using this application.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
        This application does not collect or store personal user data. All interactions with the application are limited to 
        demonstrating asynchronous programming in C# and do not involve collecting information from the user.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Use of Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
        The application fetches data from external websites (e.g., Yahoo, Microsoft, Facebook) for demonstration purposes.
        No personal user information is shared with these websites. The data fetched is only used for educational purposes
        and is not stored.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Security</h3>
    <p>
        I am committed to ensuring the security of the data processed in this application. Since no personal user data is
        collected, the risk to user privacy is minimal. Additionally, the application uses secure methods to communicate with
        external websites.
    </p>

    <h3>4. User Rights</h3>
    <p>
        As this application does not collect or store personal data, no actions are required from users regarding data deletion 
        or retrieval.
